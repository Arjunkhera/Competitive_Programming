## A curated list of links and codes for competitive programming

###Update 02.08.2018
I got placed in Adobe :fire: the first company :zap: to visit the campus, prep work from leetcode,Interviewbit and gfg has really paid off.

**This repository will be taking a break for about a month, but post that I will be updating it regularly.**

Heres a snapshot of whats to come :
1. All Interviewbit solutions
2. All Leetcode solutions[ most of the questions till 150 completed. focus will be on 200 onwards ]
3. Contests [  codeforces,hackerank,codechef,topcoder,leetcode ]
4. A single review page repository for every ds, alongwith their implementations.

### Goals :
1. Implementations of common data structures and their related questions.
2. Common algorithm questions asked in placements and interviews.
2. Will have a collection of solutions of Leetcode questions.

### To Do :
1. Put comments in the code to make them easier to read.

## Note :
1. The project is still under active development.
2. In case of any bug in the code, open an issue.
3. Codes currently are in c++, however solutions in other languages are welcome.
