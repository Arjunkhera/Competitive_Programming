## A curated list of links and codes for competitive programming

### Status :
Currently questions relating to Linked lists are being added[ 9.02.18 ]. Check out the linked_lists folder for updates.

### Goals :
1. Implementations of common data structures and their related questions.
2. Common algorithm questions asked in placements and interviews.
2. Will have a collection of solutions of Leetcode questions.

### To Do :
1. Put comments in the code to make them easier to read.

## Note :
1. The project is still under active development.
2. In case of any issue in the code, open a issue.
3. Codes currently are in c++, however solutions in other languages are welcome.
