## A curated list of links and codes for competitive programming

### Status :

[ 16.07.18 ] Interviewbit revision ongoing, solutions are being posted regularly. Leetcode recent contest solutions are also being pushed.

Contest solutions are available in folders of specific judges, you can check them out.

### Goals :
1. Implementations of common data structures and their related questions.
2. Common algorithm questions asked in placements and interviews.
2. Will have a collection of solutions of Leetcode questions.

### To Do :
1. Put comments in the code to make them easier to read.

## Note :
1. The project is still under active development.
2. In case of any bug in the code, open an issue.
3. Codes currently are in c++, however solutions in other languages are welcome.
