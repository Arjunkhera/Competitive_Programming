## A curated list of links and codes for competitive programming

### Status :
[25.6.18] A break in progress due to dish tv hackathon. Though we made it to the finals clearing the first round, we could not win it. Still a cool experience, if you want you can check out some stuff of our Team Rocket in my dishathon repository.

Currently 125 Leetcode questions have been completed :zap:
Next Target at --> 150 by 30/6/18 :fire:

:rocket: Current average of 1168 points daily on interviewbit. Target to average more than 1800 in the coming days. Lets see if it works out. The solutions for the interviewbit questions wont be posted anytime soon. But when i will start my revision, which shall be around 15 of July, i shall start posting them sequentially.

Some C/C++ notes are also being worked on, and will mostly cover STL and stuff. 

### Goals :
1. Implementations of common data structures and their related questions.
2. Common algorithm questions asked in placements and interviews.
2. Will have a collection of solutions of Leetcode questions.

### To Do :
1. Put comments in the code to make them easier to read.

## Note :
1. The project is still under active development.
2. In case of any issue in the code, open a issue.
3. Codes currently are in c++, however solutions in other languages are welcome.
