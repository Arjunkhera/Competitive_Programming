## A curated list of links and codes for competitive programming

### Status :
[16.6.18] Completed 104 Leetcode questions now :zap: beat my target by nearly 5 days :boom:
On course for Next Target --> 125 by 21/6/18 :fire:

:rocket: Also targets for Interviewbit of 1000 points daily on track, with efforts ro reach 1500 daily :).Will post solutions soon.

Some C/C++ notes are also being worked on, and will mostly cover STL and stuff.

### Goals :
1. Implementations of common data structures and their related questions.
2. Common algorithm questions asked in placements and interviews.
2. Will have a collection of solutions of Leetcode questions.

### To Do :
1. Put comments in the code to make them easier to read.

## Note :
1. The project is still under active development.
2. In case of any issue in the code, open a issue.
3. Codes currently are in c++, however solutions in other languages are welcome.
