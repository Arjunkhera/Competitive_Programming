## A curated list of links and codes for competitive programming

### Status :
[29.05.18]Currently working my way through Leetcode. Due to crunch of time lesser solutions are   
being posted. However, i will try to add as many as possible.

Some C/C++ notes are also being worked on, and will mostly cover STL and stuff.

### Goals :
1. Implementations of common data structures and their related questions.
2. Common algorithm questions asked in placements and interviews.
2. Will have a collection of solutions of Leetcode questions.

### To Do :
1. Put comments in the code to make them easier to read.

## Note :
1. The project is still under active development.
2. In case of any issue in the code, open a issue.
3. Codes currently are in c++, however solutions in other languages are welcome.
