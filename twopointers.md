1. [Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)
  - Count all occurences - two passes
  - three pointers - single pass
2. [Remove Duplicates](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/description/)
  - two pointers - single pass
3. [Remove Duplicates 2](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/description/)
  - two pointers - single pass
4. [Remove element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/description/)  

2sum and 3 sums can have varities  such as  
a. Find if solution exists   
b. Find all solutions   
c. Presence of duplicates in above two

duplicates can be handled easily, check this [leetcode solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/discuss/7402/Share-my-AC-C++-solution-around-50ms-O(N*N)-with-explanation-and-comments) for details.
