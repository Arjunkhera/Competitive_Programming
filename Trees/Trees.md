### Common Terminology ?



### Applications of Tree's ?

1. Manipulate hierarchical data.
2. Make information easy to search (see tree traversal).
3. Manipulate sorted lists of data.
4. As a workflow for compositing digital images for visual effects.
5. Router algorithms
6. Form of a multi-stage decision-making (see business chess).


### Questions :

1. Which sorting algorithm to prefer for linked list ?  
Both Merge sort and Insertion sort can be used for linked lists. The slow random-access performance of a linked list makes other algorithms (such as quicksort) perform poorly, and others (such as heapsort) completely impossible. Since worst case time complexity of Merge Sort is O(nLogn) and Insertion sort is O(n^2), merge sort is preferred. See following for implementation of merge sort using Linked List.

2. Reversing a linked list
Both iterative and recursive take
a. Time completely  O(n)
b. Space completely O(1)
